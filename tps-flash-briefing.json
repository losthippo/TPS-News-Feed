  "mainText": "Congratulations to our Connecting Citizens students, Hannah, Kevin, Maria, Mick, Natasha and Sammy. The group have their photography work on display at The Mitchell Library in Glasgow and have co-curated an exhibition with the Open Museum.
  The group decided to tackle a subject that is close to their hearts, saying, ‘We had the whole of Glasgow Museums collections at our fingertips – we could have chosen anything from art to ancient Egypt, but we wanted to focus on something contemporary and relevant – something we all had experience of. We started by looking at objects related to poverty in the Glasgow Museums collection. We discovered that they were not up to date. Does poverty in still exist in Glasgow? Look around and you will see it does. We also looked at photographs in the collections and that gave us the idea to go out into our communities and take our own.'
  Elaine Addington, Open Museum Curator, Glasgow Museums said, ‘People should go see the display firstly because the photographs are brilliant and an absolute credit to the students who took part. Also they will be images that probably resonate with the viewers own experiences of Glasgow, but will hopefully make them question their willingness to accept this as the norm.",
