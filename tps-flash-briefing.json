    "mainText": "T.P.S. Connects was created to give people a purpose and fulfilment beyond receiving support. Being part of something and meeting people can have a positive impact on health and well-being and it reduces loneliness and isolation. It provides a safe and welcoming environment, to help people feel involved, included, and to have their voice heard. Our new explainer video talks about the group and what it does. Find it on the Turning Point Scotland webpage and YouTube page.",
