    "mainText": "Congratulations to staff and people being supported by our Dumfries and Galloway service for raising money to buy a Dermlite machine for Castle Douglas Health Centre. This machine will allow GPs to diagnose melanoma and other skin cancers at a surgery appointment. Having this service locally means that people won't have to travel into Dumfries for initial diagnosis, reducing the distance and logistics of travelling.",
